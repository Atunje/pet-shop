**Make sure you set the correct database connection information before running the migrations** [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

## Database seeding

**Populate 50 orders for 10 different users with a random amount of products, these orders will get randomly assigned a order status, if the order status is paid or shipped it is assigned a payment method.**

Run the database seeder and you're done

    php artisan db:seed

***Note*** : It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the following command

    php artisan migrate:refresh
